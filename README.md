# Modified Ranging Local Test Without Crazyflie Support

## Overview
This project provides a local test environment for modified ranging without the need for Crazyflie hardware support. It consists of a drone simulator and a control center, allowing you to simulate the communication and ranging process between drones. Additionally, there is a Python script for data processing.

## Prerequisites
- A Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS)
- GCC compiler for C code compilation
- Python 3 installed for data processing

## Building the Project

### Build All Components
To build both the drone simulator and the control center, run the following command in the project root directory:
```sh
make
```

### Build Specific Components
- **Build only the drone simulator**:
```sh
make drone
```
- **Build only the control center**:
```sh
make center_control
```

## Running the System

### Start the Control Center
After building the project, start the control center by running the following command:
```sh
./center_control
```
The control center will start listening on the specified port (`8888` by default) and wait for drone connections.

### Start the Drone Simulator
To start the drone simulator, run the following command, replacing `<port>` with the IP address of the control center and `<drone_name>` with a unique identifier for the drone:
```sh
./drone <port> <drone_name>
```
For example:
```sh
./drone 127.0.0.1 drone1
```
You can start multiple drone simulators to simulate a multi - drone environment.

### Process Data
After the simulation is completed, you can use the Python script to process the data. Run the following command:
```sh
python3 data_process.py
```
This script will generate a plot of the adjusted data and save it as `data.png`.

## Code Structure
- `local_host`: Initializes the local host by setting address, base time, location, and velocity. It provides basic configuration for the system.
- `base_struct`: Define a series of enumeration types and structures, providing basic data structure definitions for the entire project. 
- `ranging_buffer`: Defines the ranging buffer structure and related operations like initialization, addition, and search. It helps manage ranging data.
- `ranging_list`: Defines a list data structure for message buffer management. It includes operations for node initialization, addition, deletion, and search.
- `ranging_table`: Defines the ranging table structure and operations for initialization, enabling, disabling, and comparison. It manages ranging information.
- `modified_ranging`: Implements the modified ranging algorithm, including table initialization, neighbor registration, and buffer data addition. It's the core of the ranging algorithm.
- `socket_frame`: Defines the socket communication framework with message structures and constants. It enables data transmission between the drone simulator and the control center.
- `drone`: Implements the drone simulator for message sending, receiving, and processing. It simulates drone behavior using the socket framework.
- `center_control`: Implements the control center for handling drone connections, broadcasting messages, and managing the drone list. It manages the overall system.
- `data_process`: Processes and visualizes simulation data. It reads data from files, calculates offsets, and draws plots to help developers understand algorithm performance.
- `lock`: Implements a thread - safe message processing locking mechanism.
- `debug`: Defines a debug printing function DEBUG_PRINT to assist developers in debugging.

## Configuration
The project can be configured through preprocessor directives in the source code. For example, you can enable or disable features such as dynamic ranging frequency, packet loss simulation, and position sending by defining or undefining the corresponding macros in the source files.

## Troubleshooting
- **Compilation errors**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed and that your compiler is configured correctly.
- **Connection issues**: Check that the IP address and port specified when starting the drone simulator match the settings of the control center.
- **Data processing errors**: Ensure that the input data format is correct and that Python 3 and the required libraries (e.g., `matplotlib, numpy`) are installed.
